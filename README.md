# Angularstart Todo

## Description

It is the most cliche example ever, but it’s a great starting point. I'm going to build a super simple todo application. All I want this application to do is:

- Allow us to create a todo with a title and a description
- Allow us to select a todo and view its details on a separate page

### Concept

> [!NOTE]
> - Using SCSS for styling
> - Will be using “single file components” — meaning that both template and styles will be defined in the same file as component, rather than being split into separate files
> - Not worrying about automated tests in this app, so can ignore the test files for now..

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0-rc.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
